# timemachine.js
An app to travel back in time through your PubNub history messages. Will allow for history pagination, step backwards through historical messages with customizable delays and of course data export based on selected time or a full data dump.

This is all due to using PubNub for systems communication and system/user I/O in interactive art pieces (digital and physical). Part of the conceptual idea of many of my pieces are based on the collection and archival of data colleced during the exhibition my work. At the moment there's no good way to get a data dump to analyize these collections. 

With these data collections, the intention is using them as a way of data visuzalization and physicalizations to foster discussion about big data and computational sensors.


# tl;dr
Wanting an easy way to export data collected and archived during my art exhibitions to explore what it means to use data as an artistic medium.
